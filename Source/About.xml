DRAKES
A previously unheard of species of intelligent serpentine aliens has come to light, aggressive in nature and evoking ancient legends with their terrific draconic appearances. Face off against a deadly new threat and make friends with a powerful new ally, the Esper Drake.

INFO
This mod introduces a new playable humanoid species equipped with vicious bladed weapons and a much higher psychic sensitivity compared to the average Human. Being natural predators, they're only equipped to eat meat and they live for the hunt.

They're not very picky about what they eat, so long as it's flesh. They'll even eat it right off the bone. It serves the Drake's intense metabolism well.

They don't care for comfort and don't mind sleeping on the floor, but an impressive living space will satisfy them all the same.

Their unusual limbs make the use of most traditional weapons effectively impossible, but they have no trouble with thrown weapons like molotovs, grenades and pila.

This mod also introduces a custom scenario granting the player five Drakes in their starting party, and a new extremely hostile faction of tribal Drakes. They can be recruited by outsiders, but it's not going to be easy - and their companionship might come with consequences.</description>
